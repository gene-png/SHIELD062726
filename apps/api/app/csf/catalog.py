"""NIST CSF 2.0 catalog: 6 functions, 22 categories, 106 subcategories.

Reference data. Immutable. The wire types live in `app.schemas.csf`;
the workspace UI fetches this through GET /csf/catalog.

Each subcategory carries:
  - code         : canonical NIST identifier (e.g. "GV.OC-01")
  - function     : 2-letter function code
  - category     : 5-character category code (e.g. "GV.OC")
  - name         : short title in the workspace tab
  - outcome      : the "outcome statement" assessors score against

Notes on counts (CSF 2.0 Final, Feb 2024):
  GOVERN   31 subcategories across 6 categories
  IDENTIFY 22 subcategories across 3 categories
  PROTECT  22 subcategories across 5 categories
  DETECT   11 subcategories across 2 categories
  RESPOND  13 subcategories across 4 categories
  RECOVER   7 subcategories across 2 categories
