"""Built-in AI job definitions (Work Order C1).

Each job is a prompt + a parser. Registered on import. The score/map/synthesize
jobs return DRAFT SUGGESTIONS only; the deterministic math lives in the
per-domain pure functions and is never asked of the model.

The prompt bodies here are the engine-level skeletons. The service phases
(D2/D3/D4/E) refine the exact suggestion schema each job emits; the parser is
`parse_json` so any well-formed JSON suggestion object round-trips.
